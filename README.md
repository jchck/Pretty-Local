### I got tired of looking at the browser default file tree

It's ugly so I built Pretty Local cause I like looking at pretty things.

* Built on the [Twitter Bootstrap] [1]

* Inspired by [Coda Emulated in Webkit by Jay Robison] [2]

Be sure to replace the background images with whatever looks pretty and makes you happy
